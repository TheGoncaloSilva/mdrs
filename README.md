# MDRS

MDRS (Modelação e Desenvolvimento de Redes e Sistemas) or Modelation and Development of Networks and Systems) is a University course that covers the performance issues of networks and services, describing the main techniques for performance analysis and resource allocation (*stochastic modeling*, *simulation*, and *optimization*). It explains how these techniques are used in the context of telecommunications network systems and their services. Ultimately, students gain skills in 
1. modeling simple telecommunications network systems and determining their performance parameters
2. evaluating the performance of complex telecommunications systems through simulation
3. allocating network resources to different types of services based on various performance objectives in networks with different architectures.

Achieved grade was 14 out of 20.
